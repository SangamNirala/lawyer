# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Fixed PDF download functionality and improved contract formatting. Resolved issue where PDF section headings contained asterisks instead of proper bold formatting. The 'Download PDF' button was not working because it had no onClick handler and there was no backend endpoint for PDF generation. Added PDF generation using reportlab library and proper download functionality. Additionally improved contract formatting by: 1) Removing all asterisk (*) expressions, 2) Ensuring proper bold formatting for headings (converted **markdown** to <b>HTML</b> for PDF rendering), 3) Adding Date of Execution line before special clauses, 4) Applied these changes to all contract types (NDA, Freelance, Partnership). PDFs now display bold headings without any asterisk symbols."

However, ❌ **bold** formatting for headings and sections is missing - the format_contract_content() function appears to be removing all bold formatting instead of preserving proper **bold** syntax. All major contract generation and PDF functionality is working correctly, but bold formatting needs adjustment."

Comprehensive testing completed: 1) ✅ Generated new contracts across all types (NDA, Freelance, Partnership) with proper **bold** formatting in contract content. 2) ✅ Downloaded PDFs for all contract types successfully with 200 status, correct Content-Type (application/pdf), and proper download headers. 3) ✅ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT MET: PDF files contain NO asterisk (*) symbols - all **markdown bold** formatting is correctly converted to proper HTML <b>bold</b> tags that reportlab renders as actual bold text. 4) ✅ Section headings appear in bold format WITHOUT asterisks (e.g., '1. Purpose' is bold, not '**1. Purpose**'). 5) ✅ Contract title and metadata remain properly formatted in PDFs. 6) ✅ All contract content formatting requirements met: asterisks only appear in **bold** patterns in source content (48 asterisks = 12 bold patterns × 4 asterisks each), Date of Execution placeholder present, clean professional formatting. The convert_markdown_to_html_bold() function is working perfectly to convert **text** to <b>text</b> for reportlab PDF generation. PDF bold formatting fix is completely successful."
