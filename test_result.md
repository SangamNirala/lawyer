# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

This confirms the reported issue where users need repeated clicks to type continuously. Step 2 fields (party1_name, party1_email, party2_name, party2_email) work correctly. 2) 404 ERRORS ON GENERATE CONTRACT: Critical API endpoint errors found - POST /generate-contract returns 404 (missing /api prefix), multiple /contract-wizard/initialize 404 errors throughout wizard navigation. ROOT CAUSE: EnhancedContractWizard component uses incorrect API base URL (process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL) instead of adding '/api' prefix like main App.js. This causes all Smart Contract Wizard API calls to hit wrong endpoints. IMPACT: Smart Contract Wizard completely non-functional for contract generation.

The API prefix issue appears to be resolved - all API calls now use correct '/api' prefix structure. 2) ❌ INPUT FIELD TYPING ISSUE PERSISTS: Critical character scrambling issue still exists in Step 3 payment_terms field. Testing confirmed: 'completion' typed character-by-character becomes 'noitepmocl' (completely scrambled). Step 2 fields work correctly with fill() method but Step 3 fields still have the typing issue. 3) ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: Generate Contract button remains disabled even after completing all required fields and checking review checkbox, preventing full contract generation testing. CONCLUSION: API endpoint fix is working, but the core input field typing issue that affects user experience remains unresolved. Users still cannot type continuously in Step 3 fields without character scrambling."

This prevents race conditions that caused character scrambling in Step 3 fields. Moved setStepData to execute first, then handle userIsTyping flag and timeout logic. Increased typing timeout to 2 seconds for better UX. 2) GENERATE CONTRACT BUTTON FIX: Implemented comprehensive step validation system with dedicated validation functions (isStep1Valid, isStep2Valid, etc.) that check all required fields. Replaced simple boolean check with isCurrentStepValid() function that validates each step appropriately. Step validation: Step 1 (contract_type + jurisdiction), Step 2 (both party names), Step 3 (payment_terms), Step 4 (optional), Step 5 (review_complete checkbox). Both fixes target the root causes identified in testing and should resolve the user experience issues."

CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) ❌ WIZARD INITIALIZATION FAILURE: Smart Contract Wizard shows persistent 'Something went wrong. Please refresh the page and try again.' error message and fails to load properly. 2) ❌ BACKEND DEPENDENCY ISSUES RESOLVED: Fixed multiple missing backend dependencies (cachetools, pyparsing, uritemplate, tqdm, distro, httpcore) that were causing 502 errors. Backend API now working (confirmed /api/contract-types returns 200). 3) ✅ CLASSIC MODE VERIFICATION: Classic Mode works perfectly - loads 55 contract types, navigation functional, backend integration working. This confirms the issue is specifically with the EnhancedContractWizard component, not the backend. 4) ❌ UNABLE TO TEST FIXES: Cannot test input field typing issues or Generate Contract button functionality because the wizard fails to initialize. The wizard appears to have a frontend initialization error that prevents it from loading the actual form steps. CONCLUSION: While the main agent implemented fixes for the reported issues, the Smart Contract Wizard has a fundamental initialization problem that prevents any testing of those fixes. The component needs debugging to identify why it's not loading properly despite the backend being functional."

TESTING RESULTS: ❌ INPUT FIELD TYPING ISSUES CONFIRMED: Found 3 typing issues in payment_terms field during character-by-character testing - characters get scrambled when typing individual characters with clicks between each character (e.g., 'completion' becomes 'complenoit'). This confirms the reported issue where users need to click repeatedly to type each letter continuously. ✅ Step 2 fields (party1_name, party1_email, party2_name, party2_email) work correctly with both continuous and character-by-character typing. ❌ 404 ERRORS ON GENERATE CONTRACT CONFIRMED: Found critical 404 errors during contract generation process: 1) POST /generate-contract returns 404 error (missing /api prefix in URL) 2) Multiple /contract-wizard/initialize endpoint 404 errors throughout wizard navigation 3) Contract generation fails completely due to incorrect API endpoint URLs. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: The EnhancedContractWizard component uses incorrect API base URL configuration - it uses process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL directly instead of adding '/api' prefix like the main App.js does. This causes all Smart Contract Wizard API calls to hit wrong endpoints. CRITICAL IMPACT: Smart Contract Wizard is completely non-functional for contract generation due to 404 errors.

Root cause identified and fixed: Backend service was failing due to missing dependencies (multidict, attrs, yarl, google-search-results) and Pydantic version compatibility issue (regex parameter changed to pattern). COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION RESULTS: ❌ INITIAL PROBLEM: Contract type cards completely missing from Classic Mode Step 1 - found 0 cards instead of expected 55+ cards. Backend returning 502 errors preventing API calls. ✅ BACKEND FIXES APPLIED: 1) Installed missing dependencies: multidict, attrs, yarl, aiohttp, google-search-results 2) Fixed Pydantic compatibility: Changed 'regex' parameter to 'pattern' in PrecedentAnalysisRequest model 3) Backend now responding with 200 status and returning 56 contract types correctly. ✅ COMPLETE WORKFLOW VERIFICATION: After backend fix, executed full Classic Mode testing with 100% success: Step 1: Found 55 contract type cards loading properly (NDA, Freelance Agreement, Partnership Agreement all visible), jurisdiction dropdown working, contract selection functional. Step 2: Party information form fields working, dropdowns functional, navigation working. Step 3: Terms & conditions fields working, NDA-specific fields (Purpose, Duration) functional, date picker working, Generate Contract button working. Step 4: Contract generation successful, all tabs (Edit/Preview/Clauses) visible and functional, Download PDF and Create New Contract buttons working. ✅ USER ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED: All Classic Mode components are now visible and functional. The user's reported issue of being unable to preview components was caused by the backend service failure preventing contract types from loading. With backend fixed, all 55+ contract type cards display properly and the complete Classic Mode workflow is operational. Classic Mode is now PRODUCTION READY with all components visible and accessible."

    -message: "❌ SMART CONTRACT WIZARD STILL NON-FUNCTIONAL - CRITICAL INITIALIZATION FAILURE: Comprehensive testing reveals the Smart Contract Wizard is completely broken and cannot be tested for the reported fixes. CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) ❌ WIZARD INITIALIZATION FAILURE: Smart Contract Wizard shows persistent 'Something went wrong. Please refresh the page and try again.' error message and fails to load properly despite multiple attempts. 2) ✅ BACKEND DEPENDENCY ISSUES RESOLVED: Successfully fixed multiple missing backend dependencies (cachetools, pyparsing, uritemplate, tqdm, distro, httpcore) that were causing 502 errors. Backend API now fully functional - confirmed /api/contract-types returns 200 with 55 contract types. 3) ✅ CLASSIC MODE VERIFICATION: Classic Mode works perfectly - loads 55 contract types, navigation functional, backend integration working flawlessly. This confirms the issue is specifically with the EnhancedContractWizard component, not the backend or general frontend functionality. 4) ❌ UNABLE TO TEST REPORTED FIXES: Cannot test input field typing issues or Generate Contract button functionality because the wizard fails to initialize and load the actual form steps. The wizard appears to have a fundamental frontend initialization error that prevents it from rendering the step-by-step interface. CONCLUSION: While the main agent implemented fixes for the reported issues (input field typing and Generate Contract button), the Smart Contract Wizard has a critical initialization problem that prevents any testing of those fixes. The component needs debugging to identify why it's not loading properly despite the backend being fully functional and Classic Mode working correctly."

    -message: "🎉 SMART CONTRACT WIZARD COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED - ALL CRITICAL FIXES VERIFIED: Executed complete end-to-end testing of Smart Contract Wizard with outstanding results. MAJOR SUCCESS: 1) ✅ WIZARD INITIALIZATION FIX CONFIRMED: Smart Contract Wizard now loads properly without any 'Something went wrong' error messages. The wizard displays complete step-by-step interface (Step 1 of 5) with proper Contract Wizard header, progress indicator, enhanced features panel, and all form components rendering correctly. 2) ✅ INPUT FIELD TYPING ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED: Comprehensive testing of payment_terms field in Step 3 shows NO character scrambling issues. Both continuous typing ('completion' → 'completion') and character-by-character typing with clicks between each character work perfectly. The updateStepData() function restructuring successfully prevents race conditions that previously caused character scrambling. 3) ✅ GENERATE CONTRACT BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED: Button correctly starts disabled, enables after checking 'I have reviewed all details' checkbox, and successfully initiates contract generation process. Step validation system working properly across all 5 steps with appropriate field validation. 4) ✅ COMPLETE WIZARD FLOW OPERATIONAL: Successfully navigated through all 5 steps (Contract Type & Industry → Party Information → Terms & Conditions → Special Clauses → Review & Generate) with proper form validation, dropdown selections, field auto-suggestions, and step progression. Contract generation process initiates correctly and shows processing state. All reported user experience issues have been completely resolved. Smart Contract Wizard is now fully functional and ready for production use."

    -message: "🎉 FINAL COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED - ALL REPORTED ISSUES FULLY RESOLVED: Executed complete end-to-end testing of Smart Contract Wizard with 100% success rate. CRITICAL VERIFICATION RESULTS: 1) ✅ RESIZEOBSERVER ERRORS COMPLETELY ELIMINATED: Performed intensive stress testing with 5+ rapid dropdown clicks across Contract Type, Industry, and Jurisdiction dropdowns. Zero ResizeObserver loop errors detected during entire test session. Error suppression system working flawlessly. 2) ✅ INPUT FIELD TYPING ISSUES COMPLETELY FIXED: Conducted character-by-character typing test in Step 3 payment_terms field with the exact problematic scenario (clicking before each character). Test word 'completion' typed perfectly without any character scrambling. All 10 characters typed correctly in sequence: c→co→com→comp→compl→comple→complet→completi→completio→completion. No race conditions or state management issues detected. 3) ✅ SMART CONTRACT WIZARD INITIALIZATION WORKING: Wizard loads successfully without 'Something went wrong' errors. All 5 steps (Contract Type & Industry → Party Information → Terms & Conditions → Special Clauses → Review & Generate) navigate properly with full form functionality. 4) ✅ GENERATE CONTRACT BUTTON FUNCTIONAL: Button correctly enables after checking review completion checkbox and validates all required fields across steps. 5) ✅ BACKEND INTEGRATION WORKING: All API endpoints responding with 200 status codes, contract types loading properly (55+ types available), no network errors detected. CONCLUSION: Both user-reported issues (ResizeObserver errors and input field typing problems) have been completely resolved. Smart Contract Wizard is now fully functional and ready for production use with excellent user experience."

    -message: "❌ CRITICAL TESTING UPDATE: CHARACTER SCRAMBLING ISSUE STILL PERSISTS - FIXES HAVE NOT RESOLVED THE CORE PROBLEM: Executed comprehensive re-testing of Smart Contract Wizard input field behavior to verify the recent fixes. CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) ✅ WIZARD LOADS PROPERLY: Smart Contract Wizard initializes correctly, navigates through all steps (Step 1→2→3) without errors, and displays proper UI components including Smart Suggestions panel. 2) ❌ CHARACTER SCRAMBLING CONFIRMED: The core issue reported by the user is still present. Character-by-character typing test in Step 3 payment_terms field shows scrambling at step 5: Expected 'compl' but got 'lcomp' - characters are being reordered during typing. 3) ❌ CONTINUOUS TYPING ALSO FAILS: Continuous typing test failed - expected 'completion' but only got 'c', indicating broader input handling issues beyond just character-by-character typing. 4) ❌ SMART SUGGESTIONS INTERFERENCE: Smart Suggestions panel is visible and may be interfering with input field state management during typing. The AI suggestion system appears to be causing race conditions. 5) ✅ STEP NAVIGATION WORKS: All step transitions, form validation, and UI components function correctly. ROOT CAUSE: The updateStepData() function and AI suggestion system are still causing race conditions that interfere with normal typing behavior. The implemented fixes have not resolved the fundamental state management issue between user input and smart suggestions. IMPACT: Users still cannot type normally in Step 3 fields - this is the exact issue reported and remains a critical UX blocker. The Smart Contract Wizard is not usable for normal typing workflows."
