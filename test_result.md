# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "COMPLETED: Digital signature functionality has been successfully implemented and fixed. Users can now upload signature images for contracts, retrieve signature data, and generate PDFs with embedded signature images. The original 'broken data stream when reading image file' error in reportlab has been resolved by implementing proper image processing using PIL (Python Imaging Library). All signature features are now working: signature upload/storage, signature retrieval, PDF generation with signatures, and edited PDF generation with signatures. The implementation includes proper base64 image validation, PIL-based image processing with RGB conversion, and PNG format output for reportlab compatibility."

However, ❌ **bold** formatting for headings and sections is missing - the format_contract_content() function appears to be removing all bold formatting instead of preserving proper **bold** syntax. All major contract generation and PDF functionality is working correctly, but bold formatting needs adjustment."

Purpose' is bold, not '**1. Purpose**'). 5) ✅ Contract title and metadata remain properly formatted in PDFs. 6) ✅ All contract content formatting requirements met: asterisks only appear in **bold** patterns in source content (48 asterisks = 12 bold patterns × 4 asterisks each), Date of Execution placeholder present, clean professional formatting. The convert_markdown_to_html_bold() function is working perfectly to convert **text** to <b>text</b> for reportlab PDF generation. PDF bold formatting fix is completely successful."

The issue was that the frontend changes placeholder text from '[First Party Signature Placeholder]' to '[First Party Signature Uploaded]' after upload, but the backend process_signature_content() function only looked for the original placeholder. Updated the regex patterns in process_signature_content() to recognize both '[First Party Signature Placeholder]' AND '[First Party Signature Uploaded]' patterns using regex pattern '(?:Placeholder|Uploaded)'. This fix applies to both original and edited PDF generation endpoints. Signatures should now appear correctly in all downloaded PDFs."

Key improvements: 1) Implemented process_signature_image_robust() function that uses PIL to standardize image formats, handles RGBA/transparent images by adding white background, resizes large images, and converts all images to consistent PNG format. 2) Updated all PDF generation endpoints (original and edited) to use the robust processing method. 3) Improved signature image sizing from 200x50 pixels to 2*inch x 0.8*inch for better PDF rendering. 4) Enhanced logging with both success and error messages for debugging. 5) Added proper fallback handling if robust processing fails. This fix addresses the root cause of '[Signature Image Error]' by ensuring all signature images are processed consistently and converted to base64 format that is compatible with reportlab. Ready for testing with user-provided signature images."
