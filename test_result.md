# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ROOT CAUSE: EnhancedContractWizard component uses incorrect API base URL (process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL) instead of adding '/api' prefix like main App.js.

    -message: "üéØ SMART CONTRACT WIZARD CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED - BOTH REPORTED PROBLEMS CONFIRMED: Executed comprehensive testing of Smart Contract Wizard functionality focusing on the two specific issues reported. TESTING RESULTS: ‚ùå INPUT FIELD TYPING ISSUES CONFIRMED: Found 3 typing issues in payment_terms field during character-by-character testing - characters get scrambled when typing individual characters with clicks between each character (e.g., 'completion' becomes 'complenoit'). This confirms the reported issue where users need to click repeatedly to type each letter continuously. ‚úÖ Step 2 fields (party1_name, party1_email, party2_name, party2_email) work correctly with both continuous and character-by-character typing. ‚ùå 404 ERRORS ON GENERATE CONTRACT CONFIRMED: Found critical 404 errors during contract generation process: 1) POST /generate-contract returns 404 error (missing /api prefix in URL) 2) Multiple /contract-wizard/initialize endpoint 404 errors throughout wizard navigation 3) Contract generation fails completely due to incorrect API endpoint URLs. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: The EnhancedContractWizard component uses incorrect API base URL configuration - it uses process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL directly instead of adding '/api' prefix like the main App.js does. This causes all Smart Contract Wizard API calls to hit wrong endpoints. CRITICAL IMPACT: Smart Contract Wizard is completely non-functional for contract generation due to 404 errors. Input typing issues affect user experience in Step 3 fields. Both reported issues are confirmed and require immediate fixes."

DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) ‚úÖ API ENDPOINT FIX VERIFIED: No 404 errors detected on API endpoints during extensive testing. All API calls now correctly use '/api' prefix structure. The API endpoint issue appears to be resolved. 2) ‚ùå INPUT FIELD TYPING ISSUE PERSISTS: Critical character scrambling issue still exists in Step 3 payment_terms field. Testing confirmed 'completion' typed character-by-character becomes 'noitepmocl' (completely scrambled characters). Step 2 fields work correctly but Step 3 fields still have the core typing issue. 3) ADDITIONAL ISSUE: Generate Contract button remains disabled even after completing all required fields and checking review checkbox, preventing full end-to-end contract generation testing. CONCLUSION: While the API endpoint fix is working correctly, the primary user experience issue (input field character scrambling) that prevents users from typing continuously in Step 3 fields remains unresolved. Users still cannot use the Smart Contract Wizard effectively due to this typing issue."

BACKEND ISSUES RESOLVED: Fixed critical AnalyticsDashboard.js JSX syntax error (missing TabsContent closing tag) and resolved backend dependency issues (multidict, attrs, yarl, aiohttp, google-search-results). ANALYTICS DASHBOARD LIMITATION: Analytics Dashboard failed to load due to API request failures (net::ERR_ABORTED), but this appears to be related to backend endpoint timeouts rather than frontend issues.
