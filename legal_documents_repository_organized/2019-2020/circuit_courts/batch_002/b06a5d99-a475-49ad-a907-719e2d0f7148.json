The district court granted summary judgment for defendants, and plaintiffs appeal. We reverse and remand.\n\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe dispute arose when plaintiff corporations challenged practices that allegedly violated federal regulations governing regulatory challenge. The challenged practices included:\n\nA. Primary Issues\n- Substantive legal violations under applicable statutes\n- Procedural irregularities in implementation\n- Constitutional concerns regarding due process\n- Interstate commerce implications\n\nB. Procedural History\n- Initial filing in district court\n- Motion practice and discovery disputes\n- Summary judgment granted to defendants\n- Appeal filed challenging district court ruling\n\nII. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review grants of summary judgment de novo, viewing evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Questions of law are reviewed without deference.\n\nB. Applicable Legal Framework\nThe legal framework governing regulatory challenge requires analysis of:\n1. Statutory requirements and interpretation\n2. Regulatory compliance obligations\n3. Constitutional protections and limitations\n4. Precedential guidance from prior decisions\n\nC. Application to Facts\nApplying these principles to the record before us, we conclude that:\n- Material facts remain in dispute\n- Legal standards were incorrectly applied\n- Constitutional concerns were not adequately addressed\n- Remedy requires remand for further proceedings\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\nThe judgment of the district court is REVERSED and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Plaintiffs may proceed with their claims under the applicable legal framework.\n\nAssociate Judge [Name], writing for the Court.\nJudge [Name] filed a concurring opinion.\nJudge [Name] filed a dissenting opinion.\n\n[Additional analysis would include detailed citation to precedential cases, statutory interpretation, and policy considerations relevant to Regulatory Challenge litigation in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals jurisdiction.]\n",
