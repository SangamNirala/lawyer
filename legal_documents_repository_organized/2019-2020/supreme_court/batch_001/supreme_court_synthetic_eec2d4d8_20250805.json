The relevant legal test requires consideration of multiple factors including constitutional principles, statutory requirements, and policy considerations. The evidence presented supports the application of established doctrine while accounting for the specific circumstances of this case.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nThe applicable standard of review is substantial evidence, which requires the court to examine the legal and factual determinations with appropriate deference to the proceedings below.
