This case presents significant issues regarding Intentional Torts.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe case arises from circumstances involving emotional distress and the application of federal law.

The relevant legal test requires consideration of multiple factors including constitutional principles, statutory requirements, and policy considerations. The evidence presented supports the application of established doctrine while accounting for the specific circumstances of this case.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nThe applicable standard of review is abuse of discretion, which requires the court to examine the legal and factual determinations with appropriate deference to the proceedings below.
