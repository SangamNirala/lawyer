  "content": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nJones v. Thompson\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n\nNo. 17–2248\n\nArgued April 27, 2016\nDecided November 23, 2017\n\nDIVERSITY JURISDICTION – CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents important constitutional questions regarding diversity jurisdiction and its application under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The central issue before the Court is whether the challenged governmental action violates the constitutional principles of due process and equal protection as they relate to diversity jurisdiction.\n\nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe factual record establishes that petitioner challenges the constitutional validity of governmental action that allegedly infringes upon rights protected by diversity jurisdiction. The procedural history demonstrates that the lower courts reached conflicting conclusions regarding the scope and application of constitutional protections in this context.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals concluded that the challenged action satisfied constitutional requirements under existing precedent. However, the petition for certiorari presented substantial constitutional questions warranting this Court's review, particularly regarding the proper analytical framework for evaluating claims involving diversity jurisdiction.\n\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS\n\nA. Constitutional Text and Original Understanding\n\nThe constitutional analysis begins with examination of the relevant constitutional text. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\" or \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" These provisions establish fundamental constitutional protections that apply to governmental action affecting diversity jurisdiction.\n\nOur precedents establish that diversity jurisdiction implicates core constitutional values protected by both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The analytical framework requires consideration of the constitutional text, original public meaning, and the development of constitutional doctrine through our precedents.\n\nB. Precedential Development and Doctrinal Framework\n\nThe doctrinal framework governing diversity jurisdiction has evolved through our precedents to establish analytical approaches that balance individual constitutional rights with legitimate governmental interests. Our cases establish that governmental action affecting diversity jurisdiction must satisfy constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.\n\nThe relevant standard of constitutional review depends upon the nature of the constitutional right at issue and the type of governmental classification or burden imposed. Our precedents establish different levels of constitutional scrutiny, ranging from rational basis review to strict scrutiny, depending upon the constitutional interests involved.\n\nIII. APPLICATION TO PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nA. Due Process Analysis\n\nUnder the Due Process Clause, governmental action affecting diversity jurisdiction must satisfy both procedural and substantive constitutional requirements. Procedural due process requires adequate procedural safeguards, while substantive due process protects against arbitrary governmental action that violates fundamental constitutional principles.\n\nThe substantive due process analysis requires examination of whether the challenged governmental action rationally relates to legitimate governmental purposes or whether it violates fundamental constitutional rights. In this case, the governmental action must be evaluated under established constitutional standards governing diversity jurisdiction.\n\nB. Equal Protection Analysis\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause requires that similarly situated individuals receive similar treatment under law, subject to constitutional exceptions for permissible governmental classifications. The level of constitutional scrutiny depends upon the nature of the classification and the constitutional rights affected.\n\nWhen governmental action affects diversity jurisdiction, the appropriate constitutional analysis must consider whether the action creates impermissible classifications or burdens constitutional rights in ways that violate equal protection principles. The analysis requires examination of the governmental justification and the relationship between the classification and legitimate governmental purposes.\n\nIV. CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION\n\nThe constitutional standards governing diversity jurisdiction must be applied in a manner that provides clear guidance to lower courts while preserving the essential constitutional protections established by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Our analysis seeks to clarify the applicable constitutional framework while addressing the specific constitutional questions presented.\n\nThe practical application of constitutional principles must account for the complex interplay between individual constitutional rights and legitimate governmental authority. Constitutional interpretation must preserve essential constitutional protections while allowing reasonable governmental regulation that serves compelling public interests.\n\nV. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION\n\nConstitutional interpretation must consider both textual analysis and practical consequences for constitutional governance. The interpretation of constitutional provisions governing diversity jurisdiction has important implications for the relationship between individual rights and governmental authority.\n\nOur constitutional analysis seeks to preserve the essential constitutional protections while providing workable standards for governmental action. The constitutional framework must be sufficiently clear to guide governmental decision-making while maintaining the flexibility necessary for constitutional governance in diverse circumstances.\n\nVI. RELATED CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINES\n\nThe constitutional analysis of diversity jurisdiction intersects with other important constitutional doctrines, including venue and venue. These related constitutional principles inform the proper interpretation and application of constitutional protections in this context.\n\nThe comprehensive constitutional framework requires consideration of how different constitutional provisions work together to protect individual rights while preserving legitimate governmental authority. Constitutional interpretation must account for the interconnected nature of constitutional protections and their collective role in constitutional governance.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the constitutional framework governing diversity jurisdiction requires governmental action to satisfy established constitutional standards under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The constitutional analysis must account for both individual constitutional rights and legitimate governmental interests, applied through the appropriate standard of constitutional review.\n\nOur holding clarifies the constitutional requirements governing diversity jurisdiction while preserving essential constitutional protections and providing clear guidance for future cases. The constitutional framework established by our precedents continues to provide the analytical foundation for resolving constitutional questions in this important area of constitutional law.\n\nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS\nMay 5, 2017",
