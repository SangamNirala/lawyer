While we cannot provide all related terms here on this site, we have selected a few of the most important legal terms for you to know. The list is general in nature and is not intended as legal advice. If there is something you do not understand or do not find here, and you do not have legal counsel to assist you, feel free to contact our law firm. Accessory Someone who intentionally helps another person commit a felony (examples – giving advice before the crime, helping to conceal the evidence or the perpetrator). An accessory is usually not physically present during the crime. Accomplice Someone who helps another person (known as the principal) commit a crime. Unlike an accessory, an accomplice is usually present when the crime is committed. An accomplice is guilty of the same offense and usually receives the same sentence as the principal. Accused A person or persons formally charged but not yet tried for a crime. Acquittal A legal judgment, based on the decision to either a jury or a judge, that an accused is not guilty of the crime for which he or she has been charged or tried. Admissible Evidence The evidence that a trial judge or jury may consider, because the rules of evidence deem it reliable. Admission Confession of a charge, an error, or a crime; acknowledgment. Aggravated Assault An attempt to cause serious bodily injury to another or purposely, knowingly or recklessly causing such injury, or an attempt to cause or purposely or knowingly cause bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon. Aggravated Battery The unlawful use of force against another with unusual or serious consequences such as the use of a dangerous weapon. Allegation A claim or statement of what a party intends to prove; the facts as one party claims they are. Appeal A request made by the defense or State that the case be reviewed by a court of appeal. Arraignment The appearance of the defendant in court to enter his or her plea to the charges. Assault Threat to inflict injury with an apparent ability to do so. Also, any intentional display of force that would give the victim reason to fear or expect immediate bodily harm. Bail / Bond The money or property given to the court as security when an accused person is released before and during a trial with the agreement that the defendant will return to court when ordered to do so. Bail is forfeited if the defendant fails to return to court. Bench Trial Trial without a jury in which a judge decides the facts. Also known as court trial. Bench Warrant An order issued by a judge for the arrest of a person. This is also known as a “capias.” Best Evidence Rule A rule of evidence that demands that the original of any document, photograph or recording be used as evidence at trial, rather than a copy. A copy will be allowed into evidence only if the original is unavailable. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt The burden of proof that the prosecution must carry in a criminal trial to obtain a guilty verdict. The jury must be convinced that the defendant committed each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt before returning a guilty verdict. Booking Part of the process of being arrested in which the details of who a person is and why he or she was arrested are recorded in police records.
