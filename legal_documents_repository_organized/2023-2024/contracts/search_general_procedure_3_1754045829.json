Share this page Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share with Email Print this page This is a general overview about civil lawsuits. It covers the main steps along the way, and the most important terms to know. As always, the caveat is that this sheet is not a substitute for an attorney. The Basics There are two types of lawsuits: civil and criminal. When someone is charged with a crime and then prosecuted by the government, this is a criminal lawsuit. Other types of suits are civil lawsuits. This is an expansive category that includes everything from suits for things like breach of contract or personal injury, divorce proceedings, cases involving child custody, as well as lawsuits against government officials and agencies. Just about any time an individual is bringing a case involving animals — as opposed to the government bringing an animal-related suit, such as when someone is charged with animal cruelty — it’s a civil suit. Below are the general stages of a civil suit and terms often found within those stages: The plaintiff files a complaint to initiate a lawsuit. The defendant files an answer to the complaint. The judge will issue a scheduling order laying out a timeline for important dates and deadlines, including when the trial will take place. The parties engage in discovery. Motions and other pleadings may be filed. A jury is selected, then the trial takes place. A decision is given by the judge or the jury. Either party may appeal the decision—and if a party is still unhappy with the decision of the appellate court, may ask for further appellate review. Pleadings/Filing The Complaint Filing the “complaint” is what begins a lawsuit. The complaint is the initial document filed with the court, outlining the basis of the lawsuit and the “relief” the plaintiff would like granted — in other words, how much money she believes the defendant owes her for the harm caused, or any other non-monetary “equitable remedy” the plaintiff is seeking, such as an animal being transferred to a sanctuary. “Pleadings” are the complaint plus certain other documents filed by both the plaintiff and the defendant, relating to the case. This will include the “answer,” which is the defendant’s response to the complaint, laying out the reasons why the suit should not prevail. Scheduling Order Early on in the process, generally after the defendant files an answer, a judge will issue a “scheduling order” laying out deadlines and important dates relating to the case. The scheduling order will say when briefs and other documents must be filed, and will also set a date for the trial. The judge may also set out a schedule for “discovery” in the scheduling order. Discovery will be explained below. Preliminary Injunction A “preliminary injunction” is an order granted by a judge prior to the final resolution of the case, that requires a party to do or not to do something. A preliminary injunction is a temporary measure that may be granted if the plaintiff can prove that “irreparable harm” will occur without it. In animal protection cases, preliminary injunctions may be granted if an animal will be seriously harmed or killed prior to the case being complete. For example, this may include cases in which a state’s fish and wildlife agency is being sued to stop a planned hunt, and the hunt will occur before the case’s finish. Another example might be if a person is being sued over their mistreatment of an animal, and the animal in question is so sick or injured she could die before the trial is through. Motion to Dismiss A “motion to dismiss is a motion filed by the defendant, asking for the suit to be dismissed because of a defect in the complaint. Typically, a defendant files a motion to dismiss early in a lawsuit. The motion will allege some reason that the plaintiff’s case can not or must not be allowed to proceed. These reasons vary....",
