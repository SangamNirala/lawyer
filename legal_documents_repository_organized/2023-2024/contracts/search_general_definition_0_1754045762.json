Bar Exam Prep» Legal Terms» ContractsContract law is a type of law that deals with the formation and enforcement of contractual agreements. A contract is an agreement between parties that can be legally enforced by a court. The formation of a contract requires an offer, acceptance, mutual assent, and consideration. Once a contract is formed, the parties to the contract are bound by its terms. A breach occurs when a party fails to uphold their side of the contractual agreement. Common remedies for a breach of contract include damages, specific performance, or allowing a party to end the contract.
