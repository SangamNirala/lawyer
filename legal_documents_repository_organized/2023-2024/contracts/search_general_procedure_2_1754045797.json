Contract negotiation hasn’t changed since the advent of email, but new technologies are making contract negotiation faster, smarter and less risky. In this article, we’ll break down what contract negotiation is, why traditional approaches to contract negotiating pose business liabilities, and how new technologies help legal teams negotiate complex agreements at scale. What is contract negotiation? Contract negotiation is the process of coming to an agreement on a set of legally binding terms (here, we’ll focus on negotiation between two companies). When two companies negotiate, both parties seek to obtain favorable terms and minimize financial, legal and operational risk. When negotiating contracts with vendors, for example, your company may push for the ability to pay month-to-month rather than annually (or vice versa). In payments, as in many other issues, there is not necessarily a “correct” option so much as an option that makes the most sense for your company. The reason we negotiate contracts in business is to ensure that our agreements set our companies up for long-term success. The long-time challenges of contract negotiation Contract negotiation is a very important aspect of contract management. Delays in contract generation or execution can slow a business down, for example, but they are unlikely to have a material impact on that business’s bottom line. A poorly conducted negotiation, on the other hand, can saddle a company with arduous legal obligations for years. In routine negotiations — a negotiation over a software license, for example — discussions focus on things like governing law, the handling of customer data, information security, and price. Company A might say to Company B, “We’re willing to buy at this price if you include our company’s standard obligations around system uptime, but you’ll have to lower the price if you want to use your company’s language.” That back-and-forth can happen in real time (in a phone call or an in-person meeting) or over email, but email tends to be more common, and the dynamics in either case are the same. Both sides offer concessions and in the process insert, remove or modify contract clauses — the building blocks of contracts — until the two sides can come to an agreement. While there are certainly best practices on how to negotiate a contract, the sheer amount of coordination required during contract negotiation makes the process a logistical challenge for all teams. Imagine having to reconcile contract feedback from a number of internal stakeholders (think Finance or Operations) and counterparties across multiple email threads. On top of that, imagine doing this for many different contracts at once. The keys to contract negotiation are knowledge management and process management: if you don’t know the history and status of each of your contract negotiations, you can’t be sure you’re achieving the best outcome for your business.
