Understanding legal contract terms Glossary of contract terms Manage your contracts efficiently with PandaDoc Try PandaDoc Are you struggling to get your head around contract terminology? Contracts are full of legal jargon and complicated language that can make them difficult to understand. But we’ve put together a glossary of key contract terms to help you out. In this article, we will help you to cut through the noise so you can figure out how to write a legally binding contract. What is contract terminology? Contract terminology is the specific vocabulary used to make sure contracts are legally binding. Some contract words are Latin, while many terms are wordy, which can make them harder to follow. But each of the contract language terms creates a commitment for everyone involved. If these aren’t worded properly your contracts will be unclear and could even be voided.

Try now Understanding legal contract terms If you are not a legal professional, you may not have come across many legal contract terms, as they’re not really used anywhere else. But this doesn’t mean you can’t learn to understand them. Some of the easier contract terminology examples are self-explanatory, such as contract lifecycle, which is basically the ‘life’ of the contract or the time it is relevant. Others, like pro-rata, Latin for “for the rate”, are better just to memorize. Understanding contract law terms isn’t just about knowing the terminology; you need to know how contracts are usually signed and how to make them work for your needs. For example, a signatory is everyone who has signed the contract. But as well as handwritten signatures, eSignatures are also legally binding. This can be more convenient and mean that contracts get signed quicker. Take a look at our glossary, and you’ll pick up some legal terms you need for your contracts. Glossary of contract terms Ab initio Latin for “from the beginning”. If you see void ab initio in a contract, this means the contract is void and can’t be amended. Acceptance of goods/services When a buyer accepts goods or services they have purchased, either with a signature or when they have been given a reasonable opportunity to inspect them. Acceptance of offer An offer is accepted on all terms set out in the contract. There can’t be any variations, or there is no contract. Addendum An addendum or addenda (plural) is any modification to a contract, including notes, additions, and deletions. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) Alternative ways of resolving a dispute without going to court, e.g., negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and conciliation. Amendments If all involved agree, amendments can be made to contracts after they are signed. But they must be signed by all parties. Also called a variation. Approval workflow A process where a contract is sent to different people within a business for approval before it is sent off. This makes sure that any mistakes are found before it is signed. Arbitration A type of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). An independent tribunal of arbitrators is called to settle a dispute so it doesn’t have to go to court. Assignment In some cases, a contract’s liabilities, rights, or obligations can be transferred to a third party. Authorized signatories The individuals who are allowed to sign contracts on behalf of a company. Automated template A master contract template created for employees to use and edit as needed. For example, this chores agreement template has space for the name of the parent and child. Days, chores, and other small details can be tweaked to fulfill the family’s needs. Banker’s guarantee A supplier’s banker acts as its guarantor, so if it doesn’t fulfill its side of the deal the bankers will cover any debts. Bankruptcy When individuals can’t pay back debts, they can declare themselves bankrupt. Their assets are shared between whoever they owe money to. Then they start afresh, with some restrictions. Bona fide Latin for “in good faith”, it relates to the level of trust needed for a contract. Breach of contract If you fail to follow the conditions of a contract, it becomes void.
