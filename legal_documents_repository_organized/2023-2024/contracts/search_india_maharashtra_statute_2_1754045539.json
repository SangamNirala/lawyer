Login To Your Account Forgot password SECTION housekeeping labour act contract labour contract labor contract labour act Country-India City-India-Mumbai Student of life 2 1 Case Overview The case is: An organization has a staff of 200 workers in Sales and Service Support in Maharashtra. They keep housekeeping directly on the company payroll for six months as a contract. Need to Know - Is the Contract Labour Act applicable in Maharashtra as the staff count is 200 with no direct workers in sales and service? - Is it legal as there are no workers, making the Contract Labour (50 workers) not applicable? - Is there an alternative way to employ housekeeping on a contract? 27th July 2024 From India, Mumbai Acknowledge(0)Amend(0) Add Reply → Start New → Madhu.T.K 4526 2 Applicability of the Contract Labour Act For applicability, the total workforce will be counted. Therefore, if you have 200 employees, the Act (whether it be CLRA or another) will be applicable to that establishment. Now, the employer can only outsource or keep workers through a contractor in areas of operations that are not perennial in nature and not connected with the core business. Housekeeping is not a core activity, so you can have workers deployed through a contractor. Outsourcing Housekeeping The alternative to deploying workers for housekeeping is outsourcing the work of housekeeping to an independent contractor. In such an arrangement, a contract for service, the agency will provide workers sufficient to make the premises clean. For this purpose, they should use their own consumables, equipment, etc. You do not know who is engaged to do the work, how many are engaged, or who all are engaged. You will not supply toilet cleaners, disinfectants, brooms, brushes, vacuum cleaners, etc., but the agency will come with all the materials and equipment required to do the work. You are only concerned with getting the result, having your premises clean, and not concerned with how it happens, how many workers are engaged for that work, and who is engaged for that. 3rd August 2024 From India, Kannur Acknowledge(0)Amend(0) CA CiteHR.AI (Fact Checked)-The user reply is correct in stating that the Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act (CLRA) would be applicable in Maharashtra with a workforce of 200 employees. Housekeeping services can be outsourced through a contractor or an independent agency. The user accurately described the options for employing housekeeping staff in compliance with the law.

As housekeeping is not a core activity, can we hire as follows: - 1.1 Can we appoint a housekeeping staff member on the company letterhead for a full-time, permanent position? - 1.2 Can we appoint a housekeeping staff member on the company role or letterhead on a contract of 6 months or 12 months? (Is CLRA registration required for this?) - 1.3 Can we appoint a housekeeping staff member on a Fixed-term contract (FTC) under the Standing Order Act amendment? Thank you. 3rd August 2024 From India, Mumbai Acknowledge(0)Amend(0) CA CiteHR.AI (Fact Checked)-The user reply is partially correct. Regarding the appointment of Housekeeping: 1.1: Yes, you can appoint Housekeeping on a full-time permanent position directly. 1.2: You can appoint Housekeeping on a company role or letterhead on a contract basis without the need for Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition (CLRA) Act registration. 1.3: Fixed-term contracts (FTC) can be used for Housekeeping under the Standing Orders Act. However, always ensure compliance with minimum wage laws, employment contracts, and other statutory requirements.

Appointing an employee under the rolls of the company is not restricted by any law. The restriction is with regard to engaging workers through a contractor for doing core work, and no such worker shall be engaged through a contractor. At the same time, you can also employ any person who is not directly related to the core business under your own rolls.
