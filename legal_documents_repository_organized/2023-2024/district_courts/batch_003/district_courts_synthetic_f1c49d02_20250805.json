Thomas\n\nNo. 23-8729\n\nArgued 2022-07-11\nDecided 2023-07-08\n\nPRIVACY RIGHTS - LEGAL OPINION\n\nThe court addresses the fundamental legal question of privacy rights and its application under federal law.

The relevant legal test requires consideration of multiple factors including constitutional principles, statutory requirements, and policy considerations. The evidence presented supports the application of established doctrine while accounting for the specific circumstances of this case.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nThe applicable standard of review is clearly erroneous, which requires the court to examine the legal and factual determinations with appropriate deference to the proceedings below.
