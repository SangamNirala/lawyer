This case presents significant issues regarding Property Damage.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe case arises from circumstances involving negligence and the application of federal law. The factual record establishes that the parties disputed the interpretation and application of relevant legal standards.
