They are not rules, regulations, or statements of the Commission. The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved these interpretations. These positions do not necessarily discuss all material information necessary to reach the conclusions stated, and they are not binding due to their highly informal nature. Accordingly, these positions are intended as general guidance and should not be relied on as definitive. The Division currently is in the process of revisiting and refreshing its interpretive positions. The new landing page below re-organizes the topics to assist users in navigating the information. Revised or new interpretations will be published here.
