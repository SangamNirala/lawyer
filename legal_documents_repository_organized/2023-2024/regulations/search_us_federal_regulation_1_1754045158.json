The FLSA is enforced by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management for employees of other Executive Branch agencies, and by the U.S. Congress for covered employees of the Legislative Branch.Special rules apply to State and local government employment involving fire protection and law enforcement activities, volunteer services, and compensatory time off instead of cash overtime pay.Basic Wage StandardsCovered, nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Special provisions apply to workers in American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Nonexempt workers must be paid overtime pay at a rate of not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay after 40 hours of work in a workweek.Wages required by the FLSA are due on the regular payday for the pay period covered. Deductions made from wages for such items as cash or merchandise shortages, employer-required uniforms, and tools of the trade, are not legal to the extent that they reduce the wages of employees below the minimum rate required by the FLSA or reduce the amount of overtime pay due under the FLSA.The FLSA contains some exemptions from these basic standards. Some apply to specific types of businesses; others apply to specific kinds of work.While the FLSA does set basic minimum wage and overtime pay standards and regulates the employment of minors, there are a number of employment practices which the FLSA does not regulate.For example, the FLSA does not require:vacation, holiday, severance, or sick pay;meal or rest periods, holidays off, or vacations;premium pay for weekend or holiday work;pay raises or fringe benefits; ora discharge notice, reason for discharge, or immediate payment of final wages to terminated employees.The FLSA does not provide wage payment or collection procedures for an employee’s usual or promised wages...",
