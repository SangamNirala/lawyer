The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European law that established protections for privacy and security of personal data about individuals in European Economic Area (“EEA”)-based operations and certain non-EEA organizations that process personal data of individuals in the EEA. It applies to the collection and use of personal information: Through activities within the borders of EEA countries That is related to offering goods and services to EEA residents, or That involves monitoring the behavior or EEA residents. The Effective Data for the GDPR is May 25, 2018. What countries are adopting GDPR? The following countries making up the EEA are adopting GDPR: Austria Belgium Bulgaria Croatia Republic of Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Ireland Italy Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malta Netherlands Poland Portugal Romania Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden UK Also Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein Why does this affect me in the United States? Personal data collected in, or transferred from, any of the above countries is subject to the GDPR. Failure to follow these regulations if they apply puts the University at risk of noncompliance, monetary fines, and reputational harm. Fines associated with noncompliance under the GDPR can be up to 20 million Euros or 4% of the University’s prior financial year worldwide annual revenue. What is personal data? Under the GDPR, “personal data” refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person (i.e., an individual, not a company or other legal entity), otherwise known as a “data subject.” Examples of “personal data” include a person’s name, email address, government-issued identification, or other unique identifier such as an IP address or cookie number, and personal characteristics, including photographs. The GDPR highlights some “special categories” of personal data, which merit a higher level of protection due to their sensitive nature and consequent risk for greater privacy harm. This includes information about a data subject’s health, genetics, race or ethnic origin, biometrics for identification purposes, sex life or sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. Although criminal convictions and records are not considered “special categories” of personal data, this information is subject to amplified protections under the GDPR. GDPR and Coded Data Of significance to the research community, GDPR considers “pseudonymized data” (e.g., coded data) to be “personal data” even where one lacks access to the key-code/coding system/crosswalk required to link data to an individual data subject. This is in stark contrast to US regulation protecting human subjects. GDPR and Anonymized Data The GDPR does not apply to data that have been anonymized. Under the GDPR, however, in order for data to be anonymized, there can be no key-code in existence to re-identify the data. For example, if Pitt serves as the sponsor of a research study with a site located in the EEA and receives only coded data from the EEA site, such data from the EEA site remain “personal data” in the hands of Pitt investigators. This is the case even where Pitt investigators have no access to the key-code/coding system/crosswalk required to link data to an individual data subject. How does the GDPR relate to research in general? It establishes the circumstances under which it is lawful to collect, use, disclose, destroy, or otherwise process “personal data.” It establishes certain rights of individuals in the EEA, including rights to access, amendment, and erasure (right to be forgotten). It requires researchers to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure a level of data security that is appropriate to the risk of the data. It requires notification to data protection authorities and affected individuals within 72 hours following the discovery of a personal data breach, which is a security breach leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.
