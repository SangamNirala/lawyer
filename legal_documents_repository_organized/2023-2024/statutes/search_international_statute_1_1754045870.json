When a product or service is new or hasn’t been regulated, yet, there’s always the possibility the risks outweigh the value. No company wants to be faced with a product recall or lawsuit, and every company knows the benefits of keeping its employees safe and secure. Standards help you avoid losses and give you a set of clear guidelines and anchors to determine whether your organization is on the right track fiscally, ethically, and legally.In this article, we’ll offer some background on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and its most popular standards, including two of the most popular frameworks for management systems: ISO 27001 for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and ISO 9001 for Quality Management Systems (QMS). We’ll also provide a breakdown of what ISO compliance means and why a company might pursue it.What Is ISO Compliance?ISO is an international non-governmental organization based in Geneva, Switzerland that initially convened in 1946 and is now one of the dominant standard-setting entities in the world. In partnership with governments, policy-makers, and academics, ISO has set over 22,600 standards, regulating products from child car seats to film speed, and presenting comprehensive frameworks for best practices in business management and manufacturing processes. ISO is best known for a few of its standards, including ISO 9001 on standards for Quality Management Systems (QMS), ISO/IEC 27001 for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), and ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety though there are many, many more that they offer.Image: ISO Standards SummarySource: ISO StandardsISO offers certification via third-party audit for a number of its standards, including ISO 27001 and ISO 9001. Although ISO itself does not perform certification audits, its Committee on Conformity Assessment (CASCO) has generated a multitude of standards on the procedures followed by certifying bodies to perform formal certification and surveillance audits. Make sure to validate that your ISO auditor is appropriately certified.While businesses are not mandated to implement ISO standards, these certifications can help solidify your organization’s reputation as a business your clients can trust, offering validation and verification that you are following international best practices. Certification helps communicate to your clients, stakeholders, and employees that protecting them is a priority to you. For instance, companies like Dropbox and Salesforce publish their ISO 27001 certification to demonstrate they care about protecting their stakeholders’ and partners’ private information and complying with ISO 27001 and ISO 27002‘s security standards and recommendations (View AuditBoard’s ISO 27001 announcement here). Now, while ISO 27001 is the standard that companies can certify against, ISO 27002 is part of the overarching standards family and guides how to implement ISO 27001’s security standards. In addition to standards that can be certified against, ISO also releases supplemental guidance, best practices, and recommendations.Achieving an ISO certification can be valuable, but also time-consuming and potentially costly. ISO 27001 certification, for example, may initially take about three to six months of pre-work for initial readiness, followed by a two-stage audit by a registrar after the first year, including surveillance audits, and renewal every three years. Before investing in certification (or recertification), many organizations opt to focus on ISO compliance first. ISO compliance is the practice of following a specific ISO standard as a guide for your organization’s structure, business operations, practices, and policies. Achieving compliance with an internal assessment can be a first step towards certification or fulfilling partner...",
