It covers all stages of the arbitral process from the arbitration agreement, the composition and jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal and the extent of court intervention through to the recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award. It reflects worldwide consensus on key aspects of international arbitration practice having been accepted by States of all regions and the different legal or economic systems of the world. Amendments to articles 1 (2), 7, and 35 (2), a new chapter IV A to replace article 17 and a new article 2 A were adopted by UNCITRAL on 7 July 2006. The revised version of article 7 is intended to modernise the form required of an arbitration agreement to better conform with international contract practices. The newly introduced chapter IV A establishes a more comprehensive legal regime dealing with interim measures in support of arbitration. As of 2006, the standard version of the Model Law is the amended version. The original 1985 text is also reproduced in view of the many national enactments based on this original version.
