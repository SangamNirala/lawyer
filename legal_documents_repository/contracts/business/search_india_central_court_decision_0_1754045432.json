No. 6178-6179/2025 Power of the Court to modify an Arbitral Award under Section 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. GAYATRI BALASAMY V. M/S ISG NOVASOFT TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED2025 INSC 605 (30 April 2025)Justices: Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Sanjay Kumar, Justice Kalpathy V. Viswanathan, Justice Augustine G. Masih.Question(s): (i) Whether the Indian Courts are jurisdictionally empowered to modify an arbitral award. (ii) Whether the power to set aside an award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 being a larger power, will include the power to modify an arbitral award and if so, to what extent.

The Court noted conflicting opinions in two lines of cases. Decisions like McDermot International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and Others (2006 INSC 325) and Project Director, NHAI v. M Hakeem (2021 INSC 344) limited judicial intervention under Section 34 to express grounds, disallowing error correction, cost reconsideration, or merit review. Conversely, cases such as Vedanta Limited v. Shenzhen Shandong Nuclear Power Construction Company Ltd. (2018 INSC 959) and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd v. Western GECO Inte...",
