Since their entry into force in January 1995, portions of these agreements have been amended and rectified several times and some were terminated. The texts reproduced here do not have the legal standing of the original documents which are entrusted and kept at the WTO Secretariat in Geneva. Introduction The WTO agreements contain rights and obligations that apply to WTO members in general. Some of these agreements also include “schedules” of commitments specific to individual members. More When signing the Marrakesh Agreement, ministers adopted the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration to formally conclude the Uruguay Round. They also signed a Final Act, which contained various Uruguay Round ministerial decisions and declarations, and the Understanding on Commitments in Financial Services in an annex. These documents have been published in the WTO Ministerial Conferences — Key Outcomes publication. Together with the Marrakesh Agreement, which was also annexed to the Final Act, they embody the results of the Uruguay Round. The Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO and its Annexes The Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization was signed in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994, and entered into force on 1 January 1995. It contains four annexes. These address trade in goods (Annex 1A) and services (Annex 1B), trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (Annex 1C), procedures for dispute settlement among members (Annex 2), and a mechanism to review members' trade policies (Annex 3). Following the termination of two agreements in the late 1990s, Annex 4 to the Marrakesh Agreement contains two “plurilateral” trade agreements applicable among certain members only: the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft and the Agreement on Government Procurement. The Marrakesh Agreement and its Annexes, as amended or rectified up to January 2019, have been published in The WTO Agreements publication. More Since 1995, specific portions of the Marrakesh Agreement have been amended or rectified. The amendments included the insertion, in 2017, of the Trade Facilitation Agreement into Annex 1A, the amendment of the TRIPS Agreement in 2017 to improve developing economies' access to medicines, and the extension of review cycles under the Trade Policy Review Mechanism, which took effect in 2019. In 2022, an amendment to the Marrakesh Agreement was adopted for the insertion of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies into Annex 1A. This amendment is currently open for acceptance by members and has not yet entered into force. There have also been amendments to the plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement and the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. Both the original and amended versions of these agreements are available below. A detailed description of how the Marrakesh Agreement entered into force and how it has been rectified and amended is contained in the introduction to the Status of WTO Legal Instruments publication. Accession protocols, which also form an integral part of the Marrakesh Agreement, are available in the accessions section of the WTO website. Key documents relating to negotiations among certain members resulting in co-ordinated changes to relevant members' goods and services schedules are available through the dedicated page regarding members' schedules.
