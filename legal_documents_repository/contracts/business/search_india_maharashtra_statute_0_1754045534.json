India follows a federal form of governance and the applicable employment laws are a combination of Central and State laws. The Central laws regulate, amongst others, the payment of minimum wages and employee benefits, such as provident fund, gratuity and bonus, retrenchment and layoffs, hiring of contract labour, etc.  The States, on the other hand, either expand upon or amend provisions of Central laws or enact other state specific laws or rules for the protection of employees.  For instance, each State and Union Territory has a separate Shops and Establishments Act (“S&E Laws”) that typically regulate hours of work, payment of wages, leave, holiday, terms of service and the like. In addition to the laws, internal policies of organisations may regulate the employee conduct and conditions of work.  However, these policies cannot contravene the applicable laws. The Indian Government has proposed codification of various employment laws under four Codes – the Code on Wages, 2019, the Code on Social Security, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2019 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020.  While these Codes have been enacted, the Government is yet to enforce most of their provisions. 1.2        What types of worker are protected by employment law? How are different types of worker distinguished? Various employment laws in India broadly classify employees in India into the following two categories: Workmen Category: Employees performing non-supervisory work, including any manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational or clerical work for hire or reward are referred to as ‘workmen’.  People who are employed in a managerial or administrative capacity and earning more than INR 10,000 are specifically excluded from the definition of ‘workmen’. Non-Workmen Category: Employees performing predominantly managerial, administrative and supervisory duties are considered as ‘non-workmen’.  Generally, they are governed by the State-specific S&E Laws, terms and conditions of their contracts of employment, service rules and agreements entered into with the employer. From various judicial precedents, it is now well settled that determination of whether an employee qualifies as a workman or not has to be done on a case-by-case basis.  The principal nature of work performed by such employee is relevant, irrespective of his designation or emoluments.  Workmen category of employees enjoy additional protections under employment laws compared to non-workmen category of employees.  Please also see our response to question 3.1. 1.3        Do contracts of employment have to be in writing? If not, are employers required to give employees specific information in writing? Generally, there is no express requirement for contracts of employment to be in writing.  However, it is a standard industry practice to sign a written employment contract at all levels.  Having said that, few State S&E Laws, such as in Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and Delhi, mandate issuance of appointment letters to the employee. 1.4        Are there any minimum employment terms and conditions that employers have to observe? Yes, various Central and State laws, depending upon the nature of establishment, category of employees (workmen v. non-workmen), the number of employees working in such establishment, etc., provide for certain minimum employment terms to be observed by employers.  Please see our response under question 1.1 above for examples of minimum terms a...",
