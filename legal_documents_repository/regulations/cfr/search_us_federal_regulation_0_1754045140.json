The SEC conducts examinations of investment advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers, self-regulatory organizations, clearing agencies, transfer agents, and other registrants. Examiners use a risk-based approach to fulfill their mission of improving compliance, preventing fraud, monitoring risk, and informing SEC policy. Examination Priorities The Division of Examinations annually publishes its exam priorities to provide transparency into its areas of focus and the heightened risks posed to investors, registrants, and the markets. Risk Alerts The Division of Examinations regularly issues Risk Alerts to remind firms of their obligations under the federal securities laws and help them improve their systems, policies, and procedures. Outreach The Compliance Outreach Program opens communication lines between the SEC and registrants, providing public forums to share information and assist firms in assessing and enhancing their compliance and controls.
