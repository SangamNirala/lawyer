Find the full text here. Their scope and purpose, as laid out in Rule 1, is to “govern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts,” and instructs that they should be construed to “secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.” More specifically, the rules govern the procedure of, among others: pleading requirements, motions to dismiss, amendments, joinder, class actions, discovery, trials, injunctive relief, and the issuance of judgments and orders. The Rules do not govern civil procedure in state court,  criminal procedure (see Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure), evidentiary rules (see Federal Rules of Evidence), or appeals (see Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure). History: Federal courts did not always have a uniform set of rules to govern civil procedure. In the founding days of the republic, rules of procedure centered around the common law distinction between actions in courts of equity and courts of law. For actions in courts of law, Chapter XXI, Section 2 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 provided that the procedural rules for such actions in federal court “shall be the same in each state respectively as are now used or allowed in the supreme courts of the same.” That is, the 1789 Act established no uniform procedural rules for actions at law, but rather required federal courts to adopt the procedural rules of the state in which they were located. Furthermore, the language “as are now used” required federal courts to adopt procedural rules as they existed in 1789. So, for example, ten years after the 1789 Act, the state procedural laws of 1789 would still govern procedural law in federal courts in that state, even if the state procedural laws changed since the 1789 Act. For states admitted into the union after 1789, Chapter LXVIII, Section 1 of the 1828 Act provided that federal courts adopt the state procedural rules as they existed at the time of admittance to the union. This principle of requiring federal courts to adopt and conform to state procedural rules as they existed at the time of adoption is known as statis conformity. In 1872, Congress passed a new Conformity Act that provided for dynamic conformity for actions at law, meaning that federal courts followed the contemporary state procedural laws. Contrarily, Congress provided for uniform rules for actions in equity in federal courts. In the Process Act of 1792, Congress delegated to the Supreme Court the power to regulate procedural rules for cases in equity and admiralty. Section 2 provides that, in cases of equity and admiralty, federal courts are subject “to [procedural] regulations as the supreme court of the United States shall think proper from time to time by rule to prescribe to any circuit or district court concerning the same.” In summary, Congress delegated the power to create procedural rules for federal cases in equity or admiralty to the U.S. Supreme Court. In contrast, for federal cases at law, Congress at first required federal courts to follow state procedural rules, as they existed in 1789 or at the time of admittance to the union, but in 1872 required federal courts to follow state procedural laws as they currently then existed. Reform: In the early 20th century, legal commentators and jurists, with the American Bar Association (ABA) leading the way, began to push for uniformity of federal procedure in cases at law. One main grievance about the system established by the Act of 1789 and its progeny was that under it, federal courts often followed the states’ rigid, statutory systems of pleading. In 1915, the American Bar Association Committee on Uniform Judicial Procedure released a report lamenting that, under the current system, “the judge is often helpless to prevent injustice being done in his very presence,” and the lawyer “is compelled to take advantage of technicalities.” The report ...",
