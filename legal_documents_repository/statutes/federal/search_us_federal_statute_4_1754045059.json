Employment law is a broad area encompassing the rights and responsibilities of the employer/employee relationship. Employment law consists of federal and state statutes, administrative regulations, and judicial decisions. Many employment laws were enacted as protective labor legislation intended for the fairness of both employers and employees, like employment discrimination or OSHA regulations. Other employment laws act as public benefits, such as unemployment compensation. Additionally, post-employment retirement benefits, like pensions, are regulated by employment legislation.Federal Statutes29 U.S. Code - Labor. Chapters pertinent to employment:Chapt. 8.
