Filing Information Where do I file my case? Who do I sue? Filing Information for Select Texas Counties Filing Your Case Online E-Books Books Where do I file my case? Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 502.4(b) states that a defendant in a small claims or debt claim case is entitled to be sued in one of the following venues in the county and precinct: where the defendant resides; where the incident, or the majority of incidents, that gave rise to the claim occurred; where the contract or agreement, if any, that gave rise to the claim was to be performed; or where the property is located, in a suit to recover personal property. Subsection (c) of that Rule goes on to state that if the defendant is out-of-state or if their residence is unknown, \"the plaintiff may file the suit in the county and precinct where the plaintiff resides.\" Who do I sue? Suing a Person If you are suing an individual, you will name the individual in your suit. Suing a Business If you are suing a business that is not a corporation, you'll need to determine who the owner is. Businesses with an assumed name (sometimes referred to as DBA, \"doing business as\") must be on file with the county clerk where they are located.
