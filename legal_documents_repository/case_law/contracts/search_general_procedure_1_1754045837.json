Share this page Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share with Email Print this page What is a criminal case, and how does it proceed through the legal system? This summary is a general overview about criminal cases. It covers the key stages and will briefly explain what might happen in court. Please be advised that this summary is not a substitute for legal advice given by a licensed attorney. The Basics There are basically three types of court proceedings: civil, criminal, and administrative. If a prosecutor files criminal charges against an individual, this is called a criminal case or criminal proceeding. Here are the general stages of a criminal case — explanations of the terms and phrases follow in the sections below: A criminal investigation is initiated by law enforcement. The defendant may be arrested or summoned into court and charged with a crime or crimes. At an initial hearing, a copy of the charges is given to the defendant, and the charges may be read to the defendant in open court. At the arraignment hearing (which could be the same day) the defendant may enter a plea of guilty or not guilty or may ask for a continuance. The prosecution provides discovery. Motions may be filed prior to trial. A jury is selected. The trial takes place. Any time before the verdict is delivered, the parties may enter into a plea agreement. A verdict is delivered by a judge or jury. If the defendant is found guilty, then sentencing will take place. If found guilty, the defendant may appeal. Here is a breakdown of the stages below. A criminal investigation is initiated by law enforcement. Law enforcement includes but is not limited to police officers, sheriffs, prosecutors, and animal control officers. They will interview any victims and witnesses and possibly the person of interest. If relevant, they will evaluate and document the crime scene. They may execute search warrants, take photographs, arrange for veterinary exams, and collect and analyze trace and scientific evidence such as DNA. If the person of interest is interviewed, this is the time when the person is advised of their constitutional right to an attorney, and that anything they do or say may be used against them in a court of law. If probable cause has been established that a crime or crimes have been committed, the defendant may be arrested or summoned into court. If a person is arrested, they are taken into custody and will be transported to a jail. In most cases, the prosecutor or law enforcement officer decides on the charges that will be filed. Additionally, depending on the jurisdiction, charges may also be filed by way of a grand jury indictment. Each state has a criminal code that guides the arrest and charging procedure. There is also a federal criminal code, if an individual is being investigated or arrested for a federal crime. If a person is taken into custody, the authorities have a very short amount of time (usually three days maximum) to file charges in court. If the accused is issued a summons to appear in court on a later date, the authorities have a greater amount of time. When charges are filed, bail (bond) will be set, If the defendant is summoned to court they do not have to post bail. A defendant may be charged with a felony or a misdemeanor and the charges may be federal, state or municipal. At an initial hearing the defendant is given a copy of the charges filed against him or her, and the charges may also be read to the defendant in open court. At the arraignment (which may be the same day as the initial hearing), the defendant may enter a plea of guilty or not guilty or may ask for a continuance: The initial hearing and the arraignment take place in a courtroom before a judge, and a defendant has a right to have an attorney present when they appear in court.
