Courts Harris County Homepage Justice Court Suits Filing Small Claims Cases A Small Claims Case is a lawsuit brought for the recovery of money damages, personal property, or other relief allowed by law.  The claim can be for no more than $20,000 (or $10,000 if the case was filed prior to September 1, 2020), including attorney fees, if any, and excluding statutory interest and court costs. Small Claims Cases are governed by Rules 500-507 of the Rules of Practice in Justice Courts. Petition To begin an action in the Justice Court, the plaintiff must file Petition in writing stating the following: (1) the name of the plaintiff; (2) the name, address, telephone number, and fax number, if any, of the plaintiff’s attorney, if applicable, or the address, telephone number, and fax number, if any, of the plaintiff; (3) the name, address, and telephone number, if known, of the defendant; (4) the amount of money, if any, the plaintiff seeks; (5) a description and claimed value of any personal property the plaintiff seeks; (6) a description of any other relief requested; (7) the basis for the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant; and (8) if the plaintiff consents to email service of the answer and any other motions or pleadings, a statement consenting to email service and email contact information. It is recommended that a plaintiff also include in the petition information showing (i) the defendant’s usual place of business or residence, or (ii) other place where the defendant can probably be found. The plaintiff must provide to the Court enough copies of the petition to be served on each defendant. The clerk may make copies of the petition for the allowable copying cost. Filing Fees The Justice of the Peace must collect fees for the filing of a Petition in the Justice Court. Section 118.121, Texas Local Government Code governs the filing fee, and additional fees for basic civil legal services to indigents (Section 51.941, Texas Government Code) are applicable. A summary of court costs and service fees is available for download. The Commissioners Court of Harris County sets the fee to be charged for services of the Harris County Sheriff and Constables. See Section 118.131, Texas Local Government Code. Issuance of Citation In order for the Justice Court to acquire jurisdiction over the defendant, the defendant must be notified of the filing of the lawsuit. When the case has been filed and the filing fee and the service fee have been paid, the clerk will issue a citation and deliver the citation as directed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is responsible for obtaining service of the citation. A copy of the petition is attached to the citation. The citation is directed to the defendant and informs the defendant of the filing of the petition, and warns that the defendant must timely file a written answer or a judgment by default may be rendered for the relief demanded in the petition. Rule 501.1. Service Outside of Harris County For citations to be served in a county other than Harris County, the constable or sheriff of that County should be contacted for the amount of the service fee and location for forwarding the citation. Service of Citation The citation may be served by any sheriff or constable, a process server certified under order of the Supreme Court, the clerk of the court if the citation is to be served by certified mail, or by a person who is 18 years of age or older and who is authorized by court order to serve the petition. Citations may be served by personal delivery to the defendant, or by registered or certified mail directed to the defendant, with return receipt requested. If attempts to serve the defendant at the defendant's usual place of business or usual place of abode or other place where the defendant can probably be found are unsuccessful, the plaintiff or the process server can ask the Court to allow service in another manner. The request for an alternative method of service must include a sworn statement describing the attempts to serve the defendant by personal delivery or certified mail, state the defendant’s usual place of residence or business, or other place where the defendant can probably be found, and describe the method of alternative service and why that method will be effective to give the defendant notice of the lawsuit. The Court may authorize service of process by mailing a copy of the citation with petition attached by first class mail and (i) by leaving a copy of the citation with anyone over 16 years of age at a specified location, or (ii) in the manner requ...",
