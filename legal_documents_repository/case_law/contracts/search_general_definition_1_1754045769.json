A bonus plan or policy sets out the terms under which bonus is to be paid. Entitlement to a bonus may be set out in a written policy providing for when bonuses will or will not be paid and in what amounts. For example, a bonus policy may provide for different payments depending on the worker’s achievement relative to certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or to the company’s Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA). Often employment contracts provide that the worker’s entitlement to a bonus payment is limited or extinguished upon the termination of employment. For example, such clauses often state that the employee must be “actively employed” on a given payment date to be entitled to a contractual bonus payment. These limitations are not always enforceable. Courts have found that the requirement of “active employment” should presume the employee will be paid what he or she would have earned had the employer given reasonable notice of termination (and been actively employed to the end of the notice period), absent a clear agreement to the contrary. See also Bonus, discretionary and non-discretionary Variable compensation Disclaimer Back to list Bonus, discretionary and non-discretionary Two main categories of bonus are discretionary and nondiscretionary bonuses. A discretionary bonus is one that the employer can choose to pay or not pay as it sees fit. When claiming compensation for a dismissal without notice, the employee would often not be entitled to a discretionary bonus payment. But that may not always be so. In some cases employees have successfully established entitlement to a discretionary bonus on the grounds that other employees in the same circumstances receive the payment and the plaintiff would also have received, had they been employed to the end of the relevant notice period.
