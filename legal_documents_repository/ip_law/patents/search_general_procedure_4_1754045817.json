With a patent, you can have exclusive rights over the manufacture, distribution, sales and even licensing of your invention.  Given how powerful patents can be, obtaining a commercially meaningful patent can be quite involved and patent registration requirements can vary between countries. A crucial step in the patent application process is the drafting of your patent specification — this is a technical and legal document which describes how your invention works and the breadth of your monopoly. An example patent specification can be seen here.  A well-drafted patent specification seeks to meet the various patent law requirements around the world, while also maximising your scope of your protection. A good patent attorney will help you protect the key inventive concept(s) underlying your invention, and not just one specific embodiment that you have come up with. On this page, we cover the seven steps required to patent protect your invention in Australia and overseas. We encourage you to follow along by downloading our patent flowchart below. Patent flowchart Step 1 – File a provisional patent application For your invention to be patented, it must be novel (new) over all public knowledge on the day your first patent application is filed. Your patent attorney will work with you to understand how your invention works and draft a patent specification to protect your invention (and any obvious modifications). A provisional patent application is a great place to start because: it establishes your invention’s earliest filing date (the “priority date”)you can deter competition by marketing your invention as patent pendingit secures pending international rights for one year while you finalise your inventionit allows the Australian Patent Office to assess the patentability of your inventionyour patent specification isn’t published for 18 months so competitors can’t know what you have applied to protect We cannot emphasise how crucial it is to have a well-drafted, broad and thorough patent specification prepared and filed with your provisional patent application. The content of this first patent specification will have a disproportionately large impact on your ability to secure patent protection in various countries around the world, and in the later years of the patent application process. IMPORTANT Do not publicly disclose your invention before filing your first patent application. Even accidental disclosures can invalidate patent protection. Patent attorneys are bound by client-attorney privilege and will treat discussions with you as strictly confidential. Step 2 – File an international PCT patent application The PCT application (Patent Cooperation Treaty) is an international-style application which keeps your patent protection pending in 150+ countries for another 18 months. The PCT application is a cost-effective way to keep your options open while you determine your commercialisation strategy and the markets you wish to enter. Some tips for filing a PCT application are below: File your PCT application before your provisional patent application expires. The PCT application keeps your patent rights pending in major jurisdictions, including the US, the EU (including the UK), China, Canada and Japan. A patent search is conducted on your PCT application and indicates if your invention is patentable. You can respond to any issues raised by the search. This can be useful if investors, distributors etc. want to know your prospe...",
